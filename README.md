# Ecommerce Automation TestNG

### This is a complete project where an [LUMA E-commerce site](https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/) site is automated by writing test suites using selenium-webdriver and TestNg as testing framework

The following key modules/pages are automated:

- **SignUp**
- **Login**
- **Search**
- **Cart**
- **Checkout**</br>

Key test cases(total **21**) are written for each module and test suites created including the positive and negative test cases.</br>A state-transition flow of test-cases are designed and run like a user buying a product from an e-commerce site.</br>
For failed test cases it will take a screenshot aswell at the point of failure.
